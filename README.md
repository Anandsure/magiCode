#### Translate YOUR language to COMPUTER language!

## Ever faced this problem?
You may be an expert at a particular language: Say Python, C++, JavaScript or even Swift.</br> 
But you've been given a task now to work with a language you really have no idea about.</br>
You know that a string needs to be input followed by a 'if condition', but don't know the syntax.</br>

- In C++ it'll be:
``` 
char a[20];
cin>>a;
if (strcmp(a,"hello world")==0){
  cout<<"\n The strings match!";
 } 
```
- In Python the same would be:
```
a=input()
if a=='hello world':
  print('The strings match!)
```



## What is magiCode?
magiCode is an assistive technology that helps people inefficient in a programming language code in that langauge using basic voice commands.



## The magiCode advantage:
- [X] Ask magiCode what you need generally like 'i need an if condition' , 'perform addition for me'. There's no need to remember any more syntaxes!</br>
- [X] magiCode will give you the required code in the language initially selected while also having the option of numerous other languages.</br>
- [X] Run the code from the compiler to get desired result in the same place!</br>
- [X] Code using your mobile phones or other devices using voice commands! Easier to solve homework questions now than waiting for your laptop to turn on.</br>
- [X] Easy to use and fast processing.</br>
- [X] Save time from scrolling through Google searching for different answers and syntaxes by having everything come up on its own in one single page.</br>



## Business model:
magiCode is a zero investment product since it doesn't need any extra hardware device to be used. </br>
Our SaaS product uses a Reduced Feature Freemium Model where users can use upto 7 programming languages free of cost to full capacity. Using more languages would need a premium account worth Rs. 100 per month. </br>
Since our major target audience is students and people new to tech, our product's price was decided to be low.
