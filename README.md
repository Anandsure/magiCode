#### Translate your language to Computer's language
## Ever face this?
You may be an expert at a particular language. Say Python, C++, JavaScript or even Swift.</br> 
But your task now is to work with a language you really have no idea about.</br>
You know that a string needs to be input followed by a 'if condition', But don't know the syntax.</br>
- In C++ it'll be:
``` 
char a[20];
cin>>a;
if (strcmp(a,"hello world")==0){
  cout<<"\n The strings match!";
 } 
```
- In Python the same would be:
```
a=input()
if a=='hello world':
  print('The strings match!)
```
The best part is YOU DONT NEED TO KNOW THIS!</br>
- [X] Ask magiCode in common language that, 'i need an if condition' , 'perform addition for me' </br>
- [X] **magiCode will give you the required code in the language initially selected**</br>
- [X] Run the code from the compiler to get desired result :+1: </br>
